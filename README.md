### As you saw in the image above, Alot has changed.

Heres a list of everything that has been changed.

- Once again, the entire file structure has changed. The file structure is more organized and has made it easy for users to change things.

- Nebula Is more customizable than before, you can know changed border-radi variables, colors, margins, etc.

- The User Profile has been moved and turned into a large pill.

- Major changes to the server list, sidebar, and chat, as well as settings.

- I've added a few easter eggs, first one to find it gets Nitro Classic for 1 month!
